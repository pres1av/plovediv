1. To start using Sass you will need to download a compiler.

	I am currently using Koala: http://koala-app.com/
	
2. Drag in the website folder. 

3. Give it a unique name so that you can manage multiple projects.

4. In the right panel, it will highlight the style.scss file. CMD Click it and set output path to style.css in the root of the website directory.

6. Good to Go!

Note: I would recommend opening both the style.css as well as the style.scss files in your editor so that you can see how the sass is affecting the css in real time.
